I am Chun.

I am from Hong Kong.
I was a mechanical engineer working at the airport in Hong Kong.
I have no prior experience with technology and data.

I would like to pursue a change in career and that there is a lack of proper education in data in Hong Kong.

So I started looking up on the internet and then I know a friend who has applied for Ironhack bootcamp in UX/UI. I expect to master in python and play with data and present them in a "professional" manner.

I would like to seek jobs in Spain or other European countries.

I might seek employment in the 'tech' industry, retail or finance industry. Still not quite sure at the moment.
I would like to be the engineer building and implementing projects, which is more inclined to the technical side.

I wish to enter a company that I like working in and be able to demonstrate my skills. May be hopefully one day I would work for Google , Spotify or Netflix. Let's see.
